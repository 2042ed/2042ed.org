# Case Studies: Commercial games
Questi sono una selezione di giochi commerciali, sviluppati diciamo come giochi di puro intrattenimento, che hanno però validi aspetti didattici e formativi.

For the selected games we try to extract the **curricular connections** (learning topics) and the **possible skills taught**.

## Adventure

### Gone home
![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/gonehome.webp)

A first-person exploration game where the player plays as Kaitlin Greenbriar, a student returning from a trip abroad. Most disconcerting is the whereabouts of Kaitlin’s younger sister Sam who has vanished, though not without a trace. To help determine what happened to Sam, the player must follow clues and journal entries to uncover numerous secrets hidden throughout the house.

> **Curricular connections:** English language arts; narrative studies; social and emotional learning; media literacy  
> **Possible skills taught:** Environmental storytelling; character development; genre; linear vs. nonlinear narrative; game mechanics and narrative; intertextuality; perspective-taking

### The walking dead
![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/thewalkingdead.webp)

The Walking Dead tells the story Lee Everett, a teacher from Atlanta caught right in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. During the game, the player plays as Lee through the trials and challenges that he and other survivors have to overcome. The gameplay is fairly straightforward, consisting mostly of controlling Lee to explore his surroundings and choosing his dialogue lines in conversation with other characters. As part of this, the player needs to act on Lee’s behalf in difficult, complex moral dilemmas.

> **Curricular connections:** Moral philosophy; ethics; social norms, history of ideas  
> **Possible skills taught:** Decision making; systems thinking; higher-order thinking skills, such as cause and effect; critical thinking; reflection; game-to-self connections; game-to-world connections; mindfulness

Tips:
1. Teachers should play the episode they will be using at least twice, as deep knowledge of the game is crucial to make the necessary curricular connections.
2. Teachers should encourage students to base their arguments on ethical theories, and not just their “gut feeling.”

### Life is Strange
![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/lifeisstrange.webp)

The player takes on role of the female character Max Caulfield, an eighteen-year-old photography student, who tries to save the people of the town from a catastrophic tornado that might befall the Bay. Playing the game through a third person perspective, the player controls the character Max’s movements to explore the game environments, to uncover the game stories through Max’s involvement in various events, and to make life-changing decisions for Max based on choices offered by the game’s branching narrative.

The player confronts several challenging moral dilemmas that require the player to make decisions, which ultimately could benefit one character but could cause devastating consequences for another.

In addition, the player can undo consequences by activating the rewinding clock game mechanic to travel to prior timepoints, and by making different decisions that can shape future events.

![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/braid.webp)
BRAID is a side-scrolling adventure. Each of the game's six worlds features a different **time-shifting game mechanic** that is used to decipher a series of **mind-bending puzzles**. Depending on the level and circumstance, time might slow down, enemies might move forwards or backwards depending on the direction in which our little blue-suited hero is running, or the clock may stop altogether. **Players can rewind time** as much as they like at any time and in any level.


### Never Alone
![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/neveralone.webp)

In Never Alone you play as a young Inupiat girl, Nuna, who goes off on a journey to discover the source of an eternal blizzard that is threatening to destroy her village. Along the way she encounters an Arctic fox and a series of spirit creatures who aid her in her journey. Never Alone is a puzzle platformer in which the player can either control both Nuna and her artic fox companion to solve a series of puzzles that require an understanding of how various Inupiat tools, environmental elements (e.g., wild animals and weather) and NPCs (usually in the form of Inupiat spirit creatures) work.

## Puzzle

![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/keeptalking.webp)
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is a cooperative puzzle virtual reality (VR) game, where players must defuse a bomb in a specific number of minutes. The game places players in one of two roles, the VR player and the manual expert(s). The VR player wears a virtual reality headset while the manual experts access a separate resource called the bomb manual. Once the game starts, it transports the VR player into a window-less, police examination-style room with the bomb and some tools. Each bomb consists of a timer and a variety of modules containing complex symbols or sets of rules. The VR player can view, manipulate, rotate, and move the bomb and other objects in the room. In contrast, the manual expert cannot see the bomb but can peruse the bomb manual.

### Monument Valley
![](../../../assets/img/played/videogame/monumentvalley.webp)
Monument Valley is an MC Escher-inspired puzzle game that bends architecture and follows a silent princess through a captivating world. 
What makes this unique is the game's landscapes. Players can drag and turn parts of certain buildings to create a path from one area to the next. And, in others, stepping on trigger squares will change gravity and have you walking along the side of a wall. The game's physics is based on perception, so if you're able to position elements so there appears to be a path, you can use it, even if that path wouldn't exist in the real world.

Players can break apart and collect these blocks using their hands, or tools crafted in the game using found materials. Survival is the key objective of Minecraft, which is predicated on players’ ability to maintain both their own health and wellbeing.
