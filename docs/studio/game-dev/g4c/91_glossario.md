### Attention
#### Focused Attention
The ability to focus attention on a single stimulus
#### Divided Attention
The ability to execute more than one action at a time, while paying attention to a few channels of information.
#### Inhibition
The ability to ignore irrelevant stimuli or suppress irrelevant reactions while performing a task.
#### Updating
The ability to respond in a flexible and adaptive manner in order to keep up with the changes in the environment.

### Memory
#### Short-Term Memory
The ability to hold a small amount of information in a readily, available state for a short period of time.
#### Naming
The ability to retrieve a word from our semantic lexicon and is considered to be a basic ability.
#### Working Memory
Refers to the temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for complex cognitive tasks.
#### Contextual Memory
The conscious recall of the source and circumstances of a specific memory.
#### Visual Short-Term Memory
The ability to temporarily retain a small amount of visual information.
#### Non-verbal Memory
The ability to store and retrieve information which are non-verbal by nature.
#### Phonological Short-term Memory
The ability to remember phonological information over a brief period of time.

### Sensation and Perception
#### Auditory perception
Auditory Perception is the ability to perceive and understand the difference between sounds.
#### Visual Perception
The ability to interpret information from the effects of visible light reaching the eye.
#### Spatial Perception
The ability to evaluate how things are arranged in space, and investigate their relations in the environment.
#### Visual Scanning
The ability to actively find relevant information in our surroundings quickly and efficiently.
#### Estimation
The ability to estimate an object's future location based on its current speed and distance.
#### Width of Field of View
Corresponds to amount of information we receive from around when looking straight ahead.
#### Recognition
The ability to retrieve information from the past and to recognize certain events, places or other information.

### Reasoning and Comprehension
#### Processing Speed
Involves the ability to fluently perform easy or over-learned tasks.
#### Planning
The ability to "think ahead", to mentally anticipate the correct way to execute a task.
#### Shifting
Ability to adapt behavior and thoughts to new, changing, or unexpected circumstances

### Coordination

The level of sensitivity with which the hand and eye are synchronized.
#### Response Time
The ability to perceive and process a simple stimulus and respond to it.

## 36 Learning principles in Videogames
| | |
|---|---|
|1. Active, Critical Learning Principle |_All aspects of the the learning environment are set up to encourage active and critical, not passive, learning_|
|2. Design Principle | _Appreciating good design_ |
|3. Semiotic Principle  | _Seeing interrelations within and across multiple sign systems (images, words, actions, symbols, artifacts, etc.) as a complex system is core to the learning experience_ |
|4. Semiotic Domains Principle | _Mastering game languages and participation in the affinity groups connected to them_ |
|5. Metalevel Thinking About Semiotic Domains Principle | _Relating the game world to other worlds_|
|6. "Psychosocial Moratorium" Principle | _Taking risks with reduced consequences_|
|7. Committed Learning Principle | _Putting out effort because they care_|
|8. Identity Principle | _Combining multiple identities_|
|9. Self-Knowledge Principle | _Watching their own behaviour and their current and potential capacities_|
|10. Amplification Of Input Principle | _For a little input, learners get a lot of output_|
|11. Achievement Principle | _intrinsic rewards from the beginning, customised to each learner's level, effort, and growing mastery and signaling the learner's ongoing achievements_|
|12. Practice Principle | _Being encouraged to practice in a context where the practice is not boring_|
|13. Ongoing Learning Principle | _Having to master new skills at each level, with cycles of new learning, automatization, undoing automatization, and new re-organized automatization_|
|14. "Regime Of Competence" Principle | _Tasks being neither too easy nor too hard._|
|15. Probing Principle | _Learning is a cycle of probing the world (doing something); reflecting in and on this action and, on this basis, forming a hypothesis; reprobing the world to test this hypothesis; and then accepting or rethinking the hypothesis_|
|16. Multiple Routes Principle | _There are multiple ways to make progress or move ahead. This allows learners to make choices, rely on their own strengths and styles of learning and problem-solving, while also exploring alternative styles_|
|17. Situated Meaning Principle | _Discovering meaning of signs (words, actions, objects, artifacts, symbols, texts, etc.) situated in embodied experience_|
|18. Text Principle | _Texts are not understood purely verbally but are understood in terms of embodied experience_|
|19. Intertextual Principle | _Relating information_|
|20. Multimodal Principle | _Meshing information from multiple media (images, texts, symbols, interactions, abstract design, sound, etc.), not just words_|
|21. "Material Intelligence" Principle | _Understanding how knowledge is stored in material objects and the environment_|
|22. Intuitive Knowledge Principle | _Intuitive or tacit knowledge built up in repeated practice and experience. Not just verbal and conscious knowledge is rewarded_|
|23. Subset Principle | _Practicing in a simplified setting_|
|24. Incremental Principle | _Being led from easy problems to harder ones_ |
|25. Concentrated Sample Principle | _Mastering upfront things needed later_ |
|26. Bottom-Up Basic Skills Principle | _Repeating basic skills in many games_ |
|27. Explicit Information On-Demand Just-In-Time Principle | _Receiving information just when it is needed_ |
|28. Discovery Principle | _Experiments and Trying rather than following instructions_ |
|29. Transfer Principle | _Applying learning from problems to later ones_ |
|30. Cultural Models About The World Principle | _Thinking about the game and the real world_ |
|31. Cultural Models About Learning Principle | _Thinking about the game and how they learn_ |
|32. Cultural Models About Semiotic Domains | _Thinking about the games and their culture_ |
|33. Distributed Principle | _Meaning/knowledge is distributed across the learner, objects, tools, symbols, technologies, and the environment_ |
|34. Dispersed Principle | _Sharing knowledge with others outside the domain/game_ |
|35. Affinity Group Principle | _Being part of the gaming world and affinity groups bonded by the game and not shared race, gender, nation, ethnicity, or culture_ |
|36. Insider Principle | _Helping others and modifying games, in addition to just playing_ |
